# Tockr
A "pomodoro technique" simulator.

Tockr helps users streamline their day and become more productive.

This is done through 25 minute work sessions in intervals that the user can set based on what kind of work session they are planning. The user can also track his/her previous work session to see how productive they are being now vs when they first started using this technique.
